I'm currently an Associate Professor at the School of Data Science (SDS) of the Lingnan University, Hong Kong SAR, China. Between 2018 and 2024, I worked as a Research Assistant Professor, Research Associate Professor and Tenure-Track Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) of the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), China. Before joining SUSTech, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL, UK) and University of Essec (UoE), UK. I received my Ph.D. Degree in Computer Science from the Inria Saclay and the Université Paris-Saclay (France) in December 2015, a Master degree in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics from the École Polytechnique and the Université Paris-Sud (France) in 2013, and BSc in 2010 from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (China). My research interests include, but not limited to, AI in Games (AI for playing games, AI for designing games, particularly procedural content generation), fair machine learning, optimisation under uncertainty (derivation-free optimisation, dynamic resampling strategies, algorithm portfolio), evolutionary computation and its applications.

My Erdös Number is 4, through Sylvie Ruette, Bernard Host and Vitaly Bergelson.

AI ethics
Intelligent scheduling
If you are interested in doing a **PhD** with me at Lingnan University (Hong Kong SAR), there are three options:

* applying for [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme 2026](https://www.ln.edu.hk/rpg/admission/application-for-admission);
* one fully funded scholarship is available for admission in January or September 2026;
* self-funded PhD for admission in September 2026.

Self-funded **MPhil** for direct admission in September 2026 is another option.

\* According to Lingnan's academic regulations, at least one co-supervisor in addition to a chief supervisor should be appointed for a PhD student. The co-supervisor would be Prof. [Xin Yao](https://www.ln.edu.hk/po/people/professor-xin-yao).

\* If you are interested in working on AI in games, please take a look at our survey ``[Deep Learning for Procedural Content Generation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-020-05383-8)'' and the [Game AI book](http://gameaibook.org/) before contacting me.
